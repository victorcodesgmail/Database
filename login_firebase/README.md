Firebase Employee Management System
This is a simple employee management system implemented using HTML, Firebase Realtime Database, and JavaScript. The system allows you to add, retrieve, update, and delete employee information stored in a Firebase database.

Getting Started
To run this system locally or integrate it into your project, follow the steps below:

Prerequisites
Ensure you have a Firebase project set up. If not, you can create one at Firebase Console.
Obtain the Firebase configuration object which includes your project's API key, authDomain, databaseURL, projectId, storageBucket, messagingSenderId, and appId.
Installation
Clone this repository or copy the HTML code into your project directory.
bash

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
Replace the Firebase configuration object in the HTML file with your own obtained from the Firebase Console.
javascript

const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
  authDomain: "YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN",
  databaseURL: "YOUR_DATABASE_URL",
  projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
  storageBucket: "YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET",
  messagingSenderId: "YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID",
  appId: "YOUR_APP_ID"
};
Deploy your HTML file to a web server or open it directly in a web browser to start using the system.
Usage
Fill in the employee's first name, last name, department, swim ability, and CNIC.
Click on the "Add" button to add the employee to the database.
Use the "Retrieve" button to fetch employee data from the database by their unique identifier.
Update employee information and click on the "Update" button to save changes.
To delete an employee record, click on the "Delete" button.
Firebase Integration
This system integrates with Firebase Realtime Database for data storage and retrieval. The Firebase SDK is included via script tags in the HTML file, and CRUD operations are performed using Firebase Realtime Database APIs.
